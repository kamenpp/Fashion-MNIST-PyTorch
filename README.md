# Fashion-MNIST-PyTorch

I made this because I couldn't find a nice, high accuracy implementation for Fashion MNIST classification in PyTorch on the internet. It reaches a 92% accuracy. The model is indeed not doing extremely well and needed to employ early stopping, because it overfits the data in only 4-5 epochs. However, this was my first try using CNNs, and I didn't aim to train the best model, but to play around with kernel sizes and depths of the network.
